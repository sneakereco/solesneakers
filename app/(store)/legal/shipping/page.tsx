              1) Processing Time (When We Ship)
            </h2>
            <p>
              We aim to ship orders within 24 hours of the order being placed, unless
              stated otherwise, and provided no unforeseen events occur that prevent
              shipment in that timeframe.
            </p>

              <li>
                &quot;Within 24 hours&quot; refers to processing time, not delivery time.

              <li>
                Processing time may be measured in business hours and may be affected by
                weekends and holidays.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some orders may require additional time for verification (for example,
                fraud prevention or address confirmation).

              3) Shipping Rates and Methods

            <p>
              Shipping options and rates are displayed at checkout. The shipping method

            <p>
              When available, we will provide tracking information once your order ships.
              Tracking updates may take time to appear after carrier acceptance.

              5) Delivery Times and Carrier Responsibility
            </h2>
            <p>
              Delivery dates are estimates and are not guaranteed. After a package is
              handed to the carrier, delivery speed and handling are the carrier&apos;s
              responsibility (except where applicable law provides otherwise).

            </h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for providing a complete and accurate shipping address
              at checkout. If an order is returned or delayed due to an incorrect or
              incomplete address, additional shipping charges may apply to reship.
